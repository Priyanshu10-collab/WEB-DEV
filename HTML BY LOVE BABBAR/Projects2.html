He offered nine of his heads as an offering to Lord Shiva. As he was to sacrifice his tenth head, Lord Shiva appeared before him and expressed satisfaction with the offering, Then, Shiva asked what boon he desired. Ravana asked to take the "Kamna Linga' to the island of Lanka and expressed his desire to take Lord Shiva from Kailash to Lanka.
        Lord Shiva agreed to Ravana's request but with a condition. He said that if the lingam was placed en route, it would become the permanent abode of the deity and could never be moved.
        Celestial gods became worried upon hearing that Lord Shiva had departed from his abode on Mount Kailash. They sought a resolution from Lord Vishnu. Then, Lord Vishnu asked Varuna, the deity associated with water, to enter Ravana's stomach through achamana, a ritual which involves sipping water from the palm of one's hand. As a consequence of performing achaman, Ravana departed for Lanka with the lingam and felt the need to urinate in the vicinity of Deoghar. 
        The story goes that Lord Vishnu took the form of a cowherd named Baiju. While Ravana was off to urinate, he gave a lingam to this cowherd. Baiju positioned the lingam on the ground. Upon Ravana's return, he attempted to displace the lingam, but he was unsuccessful in his endeavor. He became upset and proceeded to press his thumb onto the lingam before departing. The Shiva lingam was then worshipped by Brahma, Vishnu, and other deities. Since then, Mahadev has taken up residence in Deoghar as the embodiment of the Kamna Linga.[2]</p>
